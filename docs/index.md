## Quick Example

```javascript
import { ShieldFirewall } from 'shield-firewall';

// Initialize protection
const shield = new ShieldFirewall();
await shield.configure({
  protectionLevel: 'strict',
  features: {
    domProtection: true,
    networkInterception: true,
    behaviorAnalysis: true,
    predictiveDetection: true
  }
});

await shield.initialize();
await shield.start();

console.log('üõ°Ô∏è Core Developer protection active');
```

## Why Core Developer?

Traditional web application firewalls only protect server-side endpoints. Core Developer provides **client-side protection** that:

- **Detects attacks before they reach your server**
- **Analyzes user behavior patterns** to identify bots and automated attacks
- **Provides real-time threat intelligence** without compromising privacy
- **Works alongside existing security measures** for comprehensive protection
